      "Jane and Michaela met at the age of 3 in Withrow park. What started as their nannie's aligning their schedules, led to a beautiful lifelong friendship that extends to their brothers and parents. When in the same city, Jane and Michaela enjoy Winners shopping adventures, pedicures, rom coms accompanied by Ben and Jerry's ice cream, and jamming out to Taylor Swift! Despite the distance, Michaela is always just a phone call (or plane ride!) away! Her support and love has always been a constant, and when reunited it feels like no time has passed at all!",

Jane and Sarah love wine nights, chatting up a storm, manicures, and sending each other their daily Wordle and Quordle results. Sarah is always there to listen and offer reassurance and she always laughs at all of Jane's jokes, no matter how weird they are!",

They were the teachers favourites and so got sent to clean the already clean fridges in a very creepy room that no one ever used (pretty sure it was haunted). Maddy and Jane discovered that they shared a mutual love of history, especially the Regency period. They love historic fashion and costumes, film, especially BBC period films, museums and going on excellent walks. Maddy is so kind, creative and resourceful, and she has the most excellent wit and sense of humour.",

Jane and Emily are both huge music fans, love song writing, concerts, and film! Emily has such passion and determination, incredible empathy for others and such a fun sense of adventure!",

They attended the same training day and bumped into each other on the train ride home and got to chatting which is where they found out that they both had dogs named Toby and only lived a few blocks away from one another! They have since bonded over their love of musical theatre, cute summer dresses and fun cocktails!  Sarah always has her friends backs and inspires everyone around her with her can-do attitude!",
